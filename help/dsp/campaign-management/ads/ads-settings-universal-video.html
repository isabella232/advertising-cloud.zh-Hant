# Unviersal Video Ad Settings

## [!UICONTROL Insert Ad Tag]

*New ads only*

**[!UICONTROL URL]:** The VAST tag URL.

**[!UICONTROL Title]:** A title for the file, which is in the [!UICONTROL Ads] view and reports.

>[!TIP]
>
> To check the validity of a VAST tag, paste it into a browser and hit the **[!UICONTROL Enter]** key. If the tag is valid, you will see an XML file that includes `<VAST>` near the top.

## [!UICONTROL Ad Options]

### [!UICONTROL Basic]

**[!UICONTROL Ad Type]:** (Read-only) The ad type you're creating, which corresponds to the placement type to which the ad can be attached.

**[!UICONTROL Ad Name]:** The ad name. The asset title is used by default, but you can change the name.

>[!TIP]
>
> Use a name that will be easy to find when you attach the ad to a placement, in the [!UICONTROL Ads] view, and in reports. For example, describe the unit type and some key attributes (such as Holiday Product Preview: 30sec Universal Video”).

**[!UICONTROL Show Controls]:** Where to include video controls for the ad: *[!UICONTROL Under]*, *[!UICONTROL Over]*, *[!UICONTROL Bottom]*, or *[!UICONTROL None]* (the default).

**[!UICONTROL Preserve Aspect Ratio]:** Whether to keep the video's width and height proportions (*[!UICONTROL Yes]*) or to stretch the video to fill available space (*[!UICONTROL No]*).

**[!UICONTROL VAST Tag]:** (Ads using VAST tags only; read-only) The third-party VAST tag you entered as the ad source.

**[!UICONTROL Final VAST Tag]:** (Ads using VAST tags only; read-only) The third-party VAST tag you entered as the ad source with the necessary [Advertising Cloud DSP tracking macros](/help/dsp/campaign-management/macros.md) inserted, if applicable.

**[!UICONTROL Wmode]:** The window mode: *[!UICONTROL window]*, *[!UICONTROL transparent]*, or *[!UICONTROL opaque]*. If this setting isn't applicable, leave it blank.

**[!UICONTROL Video Format]:** The format of the ad player for potential inventory: *[!UICONTROL VPAID]*, *[!UICONTROL VPAID & VAST]* or *[!UICONTROL VAST]*. Viewability is always measured for VPAID, but VPAID & VAST includes inventory that doesn’t allow viewability measurement. Consider this distinction if viewability metrics are important to your campaign.
*[!UICONTROL VAST]* should preferably be selected when targeting Connected TV or inventory that strictly requires VAST format only (usually from supply sources like Google Ad Manager, Appnexus, SpotX, Freewheel)
  
**[!UICONTROL Clock Number]**: (Used only in the United Kingdom; available only to users with permission) A unique identifier used to ensure that the right ad is broadcast. If this setting isn't applicable, leave it blank.

### [!UICONTROL Pixel]

All existing event tracking pixels for the placement are automatically attached. You can detach existing pixels and create new pixels as needed, based on your tracking needs for the individual ad.

The following settings apply to each pixel that you create or edit.

**[!UICONTROL Integration Event]:** The event that triggers the pixel to fire. For this ad type, use pixels that fires on the *[!UICONTROL Impression]* or *[!UICONTROL Click-through]*.

**[!UICONTROL Pixel Type]:** Whether the pixel is an *[!UICONTROL IMG URL]* (1x1 pixel image file), *[!UICONTROL HTML]*, or *[!UICONTROL JavaScript URL]*.

**[!UICONTROL Pixel URL or Code]:** The URL of the pixel image, in the appropriate format for the specified [!UICONTROL Pixel Type].

**[!UICONTROL Pixel Name]:** The pixel name. Use a name that helps you easily identify the pixel.

**[!UICONTROL Pixel Provider]:** The pixel provider: *[!UICONTROL None]*, *[!UICONTROL Nielsen]*, or *[!UICONTROL Comscore]*.
